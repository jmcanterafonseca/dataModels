# How to map GTFS feeds to FIWARE NGSI

## Introduction

 The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), also known as GTFS static or static transit,
 defines a common format for public transportation schedules and associated geographic information.
 GTFS "feeds" let public transit agencies publish their transit data and developers write applications that consume
 that data in an interoperable way.
 
 This document provides guidelines on how to map GTFS feeds into FIWARE NGSI content.
 
 ## General rules
 
 Entity Attributes (Properties or Relationships) are subject to the rules defined by the [GTFS specification](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/#term-definitions)

## Agency

See [https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/#agencytxt](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/#agencytxt)

### Entity id

It shall be `urn:ngsi-ld:gtfs:Agency:<agency_identifier>` being `agency_identifier` a value that can be derived from `agency_id`. 

### Entity Type

It shall be equal to `gtfs:Agency` 

### Properties

Entity's properties are enumerated below:

`agency_name,agency_url,agency_timezone,agency_phone,agency_lang`

### Relationships

None

### Example

```json
{
  "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:gtfs:Agency:Malaga_EMT",
  "type": "gtfs:Agency",
  "agency_name": "Empresa Malague√±a de Transportes",
  "agency_url": "http://www.emtmalaga.es/",
  "agency_timezone": "Europe/Madrid",
  "agency_lang": "ES"
}
```

## Stop

See [https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/#stoptxt](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/#stoptxt)

`location_type` shall be 0. 

### Entity id

It shall be `urn:ngsi-ld:gtfs:Stop:<stop_identifier>` being `stop_identifier` a value that can derived from the `stop_id` field. 

### Entity Type

It shall be equal to `gtfs:Stop` 

### Properties

Entity's properties are enumerated below:

`stop_name,stop_desc,stop_url`

`stop_lat` and `stop_long` shall be mapped to a `location` property, encoded as a GeoJSON point.

### Relationships

The field `parent_station` shall be mapped to a Relationship which shall point to another entity of type `gtfs:Station`
(GTFS stop with `location_type` attribute equal to `1`). 

### Example

```json
{
  "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:gtfs:Stop:Malaga_101",
  "type": "gtfs:Stop",
  "stop_code": "101",
  "stop_name": "Alameda Principal (Sur)",
  "location": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [-4.424393,36.716872]
  }
}
```

## Station

See [https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/#stoptxt](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/#stoptxt)

`location_type` shall be `1`. 

### Entity id

It shall be `urn:ngsi-ld:gtfs:Station:<station_identifier>` being `station_identifier` a value that can derived from the `stop_id` field. 

### Entity Type

It shall be equal to `gtfs:Station` 

### Properties

Entity's properties are enumerated below:

`stop_name,stop_desc,stop_url`

`stop_lat` and `stop_long` shall be mapped to a `location` property, encoded as a GeoJSON point.

### Relationships

`has_stops` is a Relationship which shall point to another entity of type `gtfs:Stop`
(GTFS stop with `location_type` attribute equal to `0`). 

### Example

```json
{
  "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:gtfs:Station:Malaga_101",
  "type": "gtfs:Station",
  "stop_code": "101",
  "stop_name": "Alameda Principal (Sur)",
  "location": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [-4.424393,36.716872]
  }
}
```
